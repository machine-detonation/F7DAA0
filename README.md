# INTRODUCTION!!

## BEFORE YOU INTERACT

I use typing quirks and talk in fancy fonts sometimes 

I am under 16 years old.

sometimes I'll randomly go quiet during a conversation. this doesn't mean I'm not interested

I'll come as rude/mean or brutally honest sometimes.

I block freely

I make "freaky" jokes sometimes (ESPECIALLY if we are close/I know you IRL) but I do NOT mean anything by them, truly! Let me know if I make you uncomfortable though.

I am a fictionkin/synpath of [Rocket](https://phighting.wiki/Rocket). (if ya don't know what that means click [here](https://fkin.carrd.co/))

I make a ton of (un)funny puns/jokes on purpose

I quite literally have like no socials so if you want to send me something then figure out a way to get it to me
