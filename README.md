- Artist + Animator , quiet sometimes • if I'm yapping to you about my OCs or a passion project please listen I promise it'll be worth ur time

Random fact: To die of radiation from bananas , you would need to eat 50 million bananas . (idk if that is true or not but you probably won ' t fact check it)

FOR THE PONYTOWN PEOPLE: I don't mind if you come up and cuddle w/ me !

- also I'm really indecisive so if I keep rmking my straw.page or changing my pfp please don't worry about it 🥀🙏
