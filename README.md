# INTRODUCTION!!

- There's a handful of names I go by but R0cket, Crown, Bee and Redzz/Red are the ones I use the most

- certified jammer,, I really like Animal Jam :P

- Digital and Traditional artist (I'd show some art but my camera SUCKS sorry chat)

- game dev? maybe?? idk I can't code that well BUT I do have a handful of games I wanna make

## BEFORE YOU INTERACT

I'll come as rude/mean or brutally honest sometimes.

Like actual bees, I'll sting you if you pmo (aka I block freely)

I make "freaky" jokes sometimes (ESPECIALLY if we are close/I know you IRL) but I do NOT mean anything by them, truly! Let me know if I make you uncomfortable though.

I am a fictionkin/synpath of [Rocket](https://phighting.wiki/Rocket). (if ya don't know what that means click [here](https://fkin.carrd.co/))

I am under 16 years old currently. (I'll only give out my actual age if we are SUPER close friends because of, y'know, privacy)

I usually only follow friends of my friends/my friends in general and people that I think are cool/wanna be friends with

I read the GitHub profile of everyone who follows me because I'm super nosy

> ^ I'm also forgetful as hell so if I forget something like ur name please don't pelt me with rocks I didn't mean to

I make a lot of eyestrain characters on pony.town for fun

I make a ton of (un)funny puns/jokes, if you don't laugh just act like you did /silly
